\subsection{Adapting CrowdHTN for Use in Mallob}
- CrowdHTN is no longer a standalone process
- one way would be to launch CrowdHTN as a new process from within Mallob
- instead re-architect CrowdHTN to prepare it as a library for external use
- the abstractions of CrowdWorker \todo{check name!} and CooperativeCrowdWorker
- the TohtnMultiJob (representing a crowd worker) contains a thread which executes CrowdHTN internally
- CrowdHTN no longer worries about how messages are sent and received (completely agnostic to the mechanism)
- on the Mallob side, messages are received and written to a buffer protected by mutex
- the crowd thread takes all available messages and forwards them to CrowdHTN
- similarly, Crowd generates messages, hands them to Mallob and stops caring

- communication between Mallob and CrowdHTN happens via atomic boolean flags (except for the mutex'd message buffers)
- this ensures that all Mallob Job functions respond fast
- even initialization of CrowdHTN (parsing, starting the work thread) happens within it's own thread to return fast
