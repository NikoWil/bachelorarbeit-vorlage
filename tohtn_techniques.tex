\subsection{SAT-based}
- SAT-based
- often with a BFS-like characteristic (Tree-Rex, Lilotane, TotSat)

\subsubsection{Progression Search}
\cite{holler2020htn}
	- progression search is one of the best known search algorithms
	- generate plans in a forward way
	- always resolve a task that has no more open predecessors with the ordering constraints
		- own: for TOHTN: we always have exactly 1 task we want to process next!
	- progression search planners always know the current (world) state, can use this information for heuristics, pruning etc
	
	- other planners search partial plans but not in order, they thus cannot know the current world state
	
\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{Classical Progression Search as introduced in \cite{holler2020htn}}
	$fringe \gets \{ (s_0, tn_I, \epsilon)\}$\;
	\While{$fringe \neq \emptyset$}{
		$n \gets fringe.pop()$\;
		\If{$n.isgoal$}{
			\textbf{return} $n$\;
		}
		$U \gets n.unconstrainedNodes$\;
		\For{$t \in U$}{
			\eIf{$isPrimitive(t)$}{
				\If{$isApplicable(t)$}{
					$n' \gets n.apply(t)$\;
					$fringe.add(n')$\;
				}
			}{
				\For{$m \in t.methods$}{
					$n' \gets n.decompose(t, m)$\;
					$fringe.add(n')$\;
				}
			}
		}
	}
\end{algorithm}

- search-based
- lifted vs grounded
	- Lilotane, HyperTensioN
	- Panda, CrowdHTN, Tree-Rex
	- lifted: more general, less pruning?
