\subsection{The Mallob Scheduler}
\label{prelim: mallob}
all from \cite{schreiber2021scalable}
- Mallob - \textbf{Ma}lleable \textbf{Lo}ad \textbf{B}alancer or \textbf{M}ulti-tasking \textbf{A}gi\textbf{l}e \textbf{Lo}gic \textbf{B}lackbox
- Mallob contains a parallel SAT solver
- is able to solve multiple instances in parallel, adjusting resources per job on a dynamic basis
- is a decentralized malleable job scheduler
- there is no shared RAM, communication via message passing
- jobs $j$ can arrive at arbitrary times
	- for SAT: a logic formula in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)
	- each job $j$ has a constant priority $pi_j \in (0, 1)$
	- each job $j$ has a variable (over time) resource demand $d_j \in \mathcal{N}$
		- simple case: $d_j$ is the number of available PEs
	- $d_j$ allows a job how many resources it is able to utilize at most
	- Mallob expects the number of active jobs to be lower than the number of workers, i.e. that $d_j > 1$
		- each PE works on only one job at a time
	- the first PE assigned to a job $j$ is its root and is fixed over the lifetime of the job
	- the volume of a job is proportional to $d_j p_j / \sum_{j'} d_{j'} p_{j'}$
	- PEs of a job are arranged as a binary tree which is complete except for potentially the lowest layer (nodes from the right of the last layer may be missing)
	- new nodes in a job are preferably taken from the list of suspended nodes of this job
	
now from \cite{sanders2022decentralized}
- focus on (NP-)hard jobs with unknown processing time
- the job itself can be small while still being hard

according to \cite{feitelson1997job}
- Mallob is the class of Malleable load balancer that tells the user when PEs may be taken away (on suspend!)
- this increases complexity, but also allows us to react to such events
